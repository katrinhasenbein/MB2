# function to calculate the glacierized area (glacier indicated with 1)

#' @title Calculate the glacierized area
#' @description Calculates the glacierized area (in kmÂ²) from a map where the glacier is indicated by the value 1
#' @param x raster (binary map) with glacierized pixels containing the value 1
#' @param res_x resolution of the raster in x direction in km. By default 0.03 (resolution of Landsat images).
#' @param res_y resolution of the raster in y direction in km. By default 0.03 (resolution of Landsat images).
#' @examples glacier_area <- calc_glacier_area(binary_map_ndsi)
